> ***Is this a backported version?***
> **No**! This is total **rewrite** of the original addon, it all started from version `r301` for `3.3.5`and built up to the current state.

## IMPORTANT: How to install

1. If you used the default on **Skada** before, please make sure to delete all its files from `Interface\AddOns` folder as well as all its _SavedVariables_ from `WTF` folder (_just delete all `Skada.lua` and `Skada.lua.bak` for this folder. Use the search box for quick delete_). If you are new, skip this step.
2. [Download the package](https://github.com/bkader/Skada-Damage-Meter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. Open the Zip package inside which you will find a single folder named `Skada-Damage-Meter-main`.
4. Extract or drag and drop the unique folder `Skada` into your `Interface\AddOns` folder.
5. If you want to use `SkadaImprovement` and/or `SkadaStorage` modules, drop them there as well.
